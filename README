Overview
The goal of this project is to create a nice color wheel using raphael.js, css and one large image sprite.

Details
To change the selected color all that needs to change is the class name on the #selected-color wrapper. All of the colors already defined are inside the stylesheet with the image sprite positions in place.

Browser Compability
This has been tested in IE7, IE8, Firefox 3.5+, Safari and Chrome.

Future Goals
Eventually I would like to extend this to be imageless and use only CSS3 and Raphael.js
